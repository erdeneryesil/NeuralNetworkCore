NeuralNetworkMnist is a customized version of <a href="https://github.com/erdeneryesil/NeuralNetworkCore/tree/master/NeuralNetworkGui">NeuralNetworkGui</a> for the Mnist database. Although it largely has the same visual design as NeuralNetworkGui, it includes some changes. As a result, NeuralNetworkMnist is a graphical user interface application that can perform operations such as creating, training, testing artificial neural network etc. using the NeuralNetworkCore library, just like NeuralNetworkGui.
