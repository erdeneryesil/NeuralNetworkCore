NeuralNetworkTerminal is an application run in terminal, where operations such as creating, training and testing an artificial neural network can be performed using the NeuralNetworkCore library.

When we run the application, we see the name of our application, 'NEURAL NETWORK TERMINAL', at the top.

Since the application will be managed via terminal, the options will be determined using numbers. So, no matter what level of the menu, we will make every choice with numbers.

The options to be selected in the application were divided into certain categories, and each of these categories was shown as titles written in capital letters.

Let's see how to create an artificial neural network, how to open it, how to train and test it using an <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance
